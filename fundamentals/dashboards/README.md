# Custom Dashboards

**Dashboards** are collections of visualized data entities created on the platform: [cost-view.md](../cost-transparency/key-concepts/cost-view.md "mention") abd [unit-metric.md](../unit-metrics/key-concepts/unit-metric.md "mention").

Dashboards represent a shareable object within the platform â€“ they can be created, saved, changed, deleted, shared and restricted.
