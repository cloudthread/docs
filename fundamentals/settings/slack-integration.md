## Slack Integration

In order to setup **Slack** for [alerts.md](../notifications/alerts.md "mention") and [reports.md](../notifications/reports.md "mention") you need to navigate to **Settings** menu item at the bottom part of the menu to the left, choose **Integrations** section and click Slack button.

After that you will be redirected to the Slack setup page.

Once you have Slack setup, you will have your workspace channels available in [setting-up-alerts-and-reports.md](../../guides/monitoring-cloud-costs/setting-up-alerts-and-reports.md "mention").

## JIRA Integration

In order to use [savings-threads.md](../cost-savings/key-concepts/savings-threads.md "mention") workflow functionality, you need to set up **JIRA integration.**
