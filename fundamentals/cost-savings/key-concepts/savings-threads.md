# Savings Threads

**Savings Thread** is a grouping of multiple [optimization-opportunities.md](optimization-opportunities.md "mention") aimed at the creation of **cloud cost optimization workflow**.

It is a key concept of [..](../ "mention") functionality Cloudthread platform provides, and it allows for bundling various related resources and optimization actions into a single thread that can be shared with stakeholders and tracked.

{% hint style="success" %}
See [creating-saving-threads.md](../../../guides/optimizing-cloud-costs/creating-saving-threads.md "mention") guide for the instructions on how to create your first Thread.

## Key Features

{% hint style="info" %}
**Savings Thread** serves as a **mini-project for cloud cost optimization**.

It is designed to be **shared** with the stakeholders and provides them with convenient context regarding the optimization, which is not just a summary of data points from [optimization-opportunities.md](optimization-opportunities.md "mention"), but additional insight based on opportunity inter-dependencies.

Thread also allows to **track** optimization implementation progress and **report** on status and results.
