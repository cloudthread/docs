# Cost View Library

**Cost View Library** is the section of the app where you can see all the saved [cost-view.md](cost-view.md "mention") listed: both custom and predefined ones. It is a convenient entry point into absolute cost analysis.

There are **three** types of metics in the Library:

* **Base** views are predefined by Cloudthread and are available after onboarding and data refresh
  * These are the general **spend categories** based on service classification according to AWS: [https://aws.amazon.com/products/](https://aws.amazon.com/products/)
* **Custom** cost views are defined by Cloudthread users through Create New View form and [costs-overview.md](costs-overview.md "mention") filtering and saving functionality
  * See [creating-custom-cost-views.md](../../guides/creating-custom-cost-views.md "mention") for instructions
* **Team Global Filters** are the Cost Views defining the filters applied to [teams.md](../settings/teams.md "mention")
  * These Cost Views can be adjusted by Admin only and will be applied to all members of a Team
