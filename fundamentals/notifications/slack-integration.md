# Slack Integration

On order to setup Slack for [alerts.md](alerts.md "mention") and [reports.md](reports.md "mention") you need to follow this guide: [https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

Once you have **webhooks** setup, you will need to enter then into the dedicated fields outlined in [setting-up-alerts-and-reports.md](../../guides/setting-up-alerts-and-reports.md "mention").
