# Ingesting Custom Data

Cloudthread allows to ingest **custom data streams** through the [custom-data-api.md](../../fundamentals/custom-data-api.md "mention"). Tis feature expands the analytical capabilities of the platform beyond the cloud data and unlocks limitless options for metric creation.

## What do I need it for? <a href="#what-do-i-need-it-for" id="what-do-i-need-it-for"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Adding a custom data integration allows to:

* **Create** _business_ unit metrics based on the data from you organization's data warehouse, such as Customers, Orders, Reservations, etc.
* **Create** _engineering_ unit metrics based on the data from you organization's monitoring systems that are not supported by Cloudthread natively
{% endhint %}
