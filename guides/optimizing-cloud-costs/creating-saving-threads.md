# Creating Saving Threads

Once you have analyzed the optimization opportunities found in your cloud environment by Cloudthread (see [analyzing-optimization-opportunities.md](analyzing-optimization-opportunities.md "mention")), you can sart creating the **workflows** around them. This guide will walk you through the creation of your first **cost optimization workflow** with [savings-threads.md](../../fundamentals/cost-savings/key-concepts/savings-threads.md "mention").

## What do I need it for?

{% hint style="info" %}

* **Analyze** the enriched context and implementation
* **Share** the enriched context on the group of opportunities with stakeholders through Jira
  * See [#jira-integration](../../fundamentals/settings/slack-integration.md#jira-integration "mention") for instructions on setting up the integration
