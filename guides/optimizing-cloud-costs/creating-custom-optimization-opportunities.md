# Creating Manual Savings Opportunities

Cloudthread **automatically** analyzes your cloud environment and identifies [optimization-opportunities.md](../../fundamentals/cost-savings/key-concepts/optimization-opportunities.md "mention"). However, the platform also supports creation of **custom** opportunities for **ad-hoc** optimization needs (see [#optimization-type](../../fundamentals/cost-savings/key-concepts/optimization-opportunities.md#optimization-type "mention") for more details).

## What do I need it for?

{% hint style="info" %}

* **Review the** enriched context enriched context and implementation instructions
* **Track** the progress of recommendation implementation via statuses
