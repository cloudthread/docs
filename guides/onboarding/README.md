# Onboarding

Onboarding to Cloudthread platform is a streamlined process, consisting of 2 steps: setting up your account and adding permissions for your cloud environments.

{% hint style="info" %}
Cloudthread is supporting only **AWS** at the moment. **Google Cloud** integration is on the way. If you are using other cloud providers, please let us know [here](https://www.cloudthread.io/contact-us).
{% endhint %}

## 1. Create and confirm Cloudthread account

After your account is [created](https://app.core.cloudthread.io/sign-up/) and confirmed via email, you'll be prompted to get connected to your cloud environment. The account creation process is quite standard and requires you to sign-up with email, Google or GitHub.
