# Setting Budgets

As you are getting [cost-view.md](../fundamentals/cost-transparency/cost-view.md "mention") created for various stakeholders (see [creating-custom-cost-views.md](creating-custom-cost-views.md "mention") guide for how-to) it is beneficial to have [budgets.md](../fundamentals/cost-transparency/budgets.md "mention") **** visible **** in case you are having such a process in your FinOps practice.

Cloudthread platform allows setting one budget per cost view and displaying it on the [#absolute-cost-chart](../fundamentals/cost-transparency/costs-overview.md#absolute-cost-chart "mention").

## What do I need it for? <a href="#what-do-i-need-it-for" id="what-do-i-need-it-for"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Adding a budget to a Cost View allows to:

* **Inform** stakeholders on the total cloud spend budget they have to fit in
* **Notify** cloud bill owners as well as users when the budget has been broken
* **Compare** forecasted spend to the budget to plan for a preemptive corrective action
{% endhint %}
