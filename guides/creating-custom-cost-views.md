# Creating custom Cost Views

Once your AWS account is connected, Cloudthread is ready to serve you cost insights. You might want to start with exploring the absolute spend your environment has generated, and create custom [cost-view.md](../fundamentals/cost-transparency/cost-view.md "mention") using our [cost-transparency](../fundamentals/cost-transparency/ "mention") feature.

## What do I need it for?

{% hint style="info" %}
Creating custom [cost-view.md](../fundamentals/cost-transparency/cost-view.md "mention") can help you to:

* Find out answers to the questions like "How much did my **team** spend in total on **EC2** (S3, RDS, etc.) last **week** (month, yers, etc.), and how is this spend distributed across AWS **regions** (accounts, operations, etc.)?"
* See the **trends** for your absolute cloud spend
* See the breakdown of your costs by various dimensions to understand top spending categories
* [drill-down.md](../fundamentals/drill-down.md "mention") from the Cost View into cloud spend to identify root cause of the spike in costs you see
  * Check out [performing-root-cause-analysis.md](performing-root-cause-analysis.md "mention") guide to learn more
* Set up reports and alerts for the Cost View, so that you can be notified on important changes in your cloud spend
  * Check out [setting-up-alerts-and-reports.md](setting-up-alerts-and-reports.md "mention") guide to learn more
{% endhint %}

4. Check the charts if they represent the data you were looking for
