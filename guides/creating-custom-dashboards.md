# Creating Custom Dashboards

Custom [dashboards](../fundamentals/dashboards/ "mention") are a great way to flexibly visualize the data within the Cloudthread platform as well as to share it with stakeholders in a more controlled way.

## What do I need it for?

{% hint style="info" %}
Creating custom [dashboards](../fundamentals/dashboards/ "mention") can help you to:

* **Get** all the relevant data into one place
* **Build** the data story and share it with the stakeholders
* **Restrict** **access** to data for certain users
{% endhint %}

## Detailed instructions

1. Navigate to [dashboards-lab.md](../fundamentals/dashboards/dashboards-lab.md "mention")section in [dashboards](../fundamentals/dashboards/ "mention")space in the menu to the left:
   * You can get there via several different paths:
     * From the menu pane at the left
     * From the [dashboards-library.md](../fundamentals/dashboards/dashboards-library.md "mention") by clicking "Create New Dashboard"
       * A good practice is to explore the Library if the dashboard you want to create already exists
   * You will see a page with empty widget placeholders
2. Place the widgets on the dashboard:
   1. Click Add Widget button
   2. Choose Widget Type
      * Cost View or Unit Metric
   3. Choose data object to visualize
      * Any saved Cost View or Unit Metric
   4. Choose **Duration**
      * This is the number of time data points to show on chart
   5. Choose **Granularity**
      * This is the granularity of data â€“ day, week, month, quarter, year
