Creating custom [Cost Views](docId:11KMWasMuEQVz6pTZpt_y) can help you to:

*   Find out answers to the questions like "How much did my** team **spend in total on **EC2 **(S3, RDS, etc.) last **week** (month, yers, etc.), and how is this spend distributed across AWS **regions **(accounts, operations, etc.)?"

*   See the **trends** for your absolute cloud spend

*   See the breakdown of your costs by various dimensions to understand top spending categories

*   [Drill-Down](docId\:V-1psXiquRudr_pum2UdI) from the Cost View into cloud spend to identify root cause analysis for the spike in costs you see

    *   Check out [Performing Root Cause Analysis](docId\:T9mISurBuYA6T7iRWc2_T) guide to learn more

*   Set up reports and alerts for the Cost View, so that you can be notified on important changes in your cloud spend
